#Exercise: guess my number

#In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!

#The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? Using bisection search, the computer will guess the user's secret number!

#Here is a transcript of an example session:

#Please think of a number between 0 and 100!
#Is your secret number 50?
#Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
#Is your secret number 75?
#Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
#Is your secret number 87?
#Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. h
#Is your secret number 81?
#Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
#Is your secret number 84?
#Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. h
#Is your secret number 82?
#Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
#Is your secret number 83?
#Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. c
#Game over. Your secret number was: 83
#Note: your program should use input to obtain the user's input! Be sure to handle the case when the user's input is not one of h, l, or c.

#When the user enters something invalid, you should print out a message to the user explaining you did not understand their input. Then, you should re-ask the question, and prompt again for input. For example:

#Is your secret number 91?
#Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. y
#Sorry, I did not understand your input.
#Is your secret number 91?
#Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. c

# Paste your code into this box
epsilon = 0.01

low = 0
high = 100
ans = (low + high)//2

print("Please think of a number between 0 and 100!")

while abs(ans - high) >= epsilon:    
    print("Is your secret number",str(ans), "?")
    letter = input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. ")
    if letter == 'h':
        high = ans
    elif letter == 'l':
        low = ans
    elif letter =='c':
            break
    else:
        print("Sorry, I did not understand your input.")
    ans = (low + high)//2
print("Game over. Your secret number was:", str(ans))
